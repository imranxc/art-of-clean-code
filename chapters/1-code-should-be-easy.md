# Chapter 1: Code Should Be Easy to Understand

Our study of bad code reveals a central principle:

> Code should be easy to understand.

## What makes code "Better"?

Programmers often rely on intuition for coding decisions. For instance:

```cpp
for (Node* node = list->head; node != NULL; node = node->next) {
	cout << node->data;
}
```

A clearer alternative might be:

```cpp
Node* node = list->head;

if (node == NULL) {
	return;
}

while (node->next != NULL) {
	cout << node->data;
	node = node->next;
}

if (node != NULL) {
	cout << node->data;
}
```

But sometimes, the choice isnâ€™t so straightforward. For example:

```cpp
// 1st version
return exponent >= 0 ? mantissa * (1 << exponent) : mantissa / (1 << -exponent);

// 2nd version
if (exponent >= 0) {
	return mantissa * (1 << exponent);
} else {
	return mantissa / (1 << -exponent);
}
```

The first version is compact but the second is clearer. How do you decide?

Here comes the FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM:

> Code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to understand it.

If you were to take a typical colleague of yours, and measure how much time it took him to read through your code and understand it, this *time-till-understanding* is the theoretical metric you want to minimize.

## Is Smaller Always Better?

Fewer lines of code is often desirable, but not always. For example:

```cpp
assert((!(bucket = findBucket(key))) || !bucket->isOccupied());
```

is harder to grasp than:

```cpp
bucket = findBucket(key);

if (bucket != NULL) {
	assert(!bucket->isOccupied());
} 
```

Minimizing time-till-understanding is more important than simply reducing line count.

### Does Time-Till-Understanding Conflict with Other Goals?

You might wonder if making code easy to understand conflicts with goals like efficiency or testability. In practice, well-understood code often ends up well-architected and easy to test, even in optimized scenarios.
